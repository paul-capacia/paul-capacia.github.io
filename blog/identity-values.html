          <p>
            According to the DOPE Personality Test, I am an OWL.

            Owls are methodical, logical and seen as perfectionist. They can be slow to make decisions and inflexible if rules and logic says otherwise. They are not big risk takers but love the detail.

              Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

                  My partner and I had always dreamt of migrating to another country. However, when my wife initilly expressed her desire to start the application process, I hesitated. We were facing financial constraints at that time, with just enough to cover our bills, and we were also expecting a baby. Concerns about the challenges of finding employment in New Zealand and the complex process of securing sponsorship held me back from fully supporting her. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Despite my reservations,my wife was determined and began taking steps towards her goal. She pursued teacher registration and actively applied for jobs. With each updater she received, I witnessed us getting closer to realizing her aspirations. Eventually, she successfully secured a job offer, and we were sponsored to move to New Zealand. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Reflecting now on those past decisions, I now wonder if I had been overly cautious and if I should have wholeheartedly supported her from the beginning. This experience has taught me the importance of the value of taking calculated risks and embracing opportunities, especially if they align with our long-terms goals as a family.

            <br>
            <li>
              Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
              <br>
              <br>

                  <li>
                    My upbringing within my family has greatly influenced my values and identity. In our household, we were taught to appreciate and be content with what we have. Both my parents, who are engineers, worked hard to provide for our family and achieve a middle-class lifestyle in the Philippines. They instilled in me the importance of being grateful for the opportunities we had and encouraged a mindset of stability and security.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                    I witnessed their dedication to their careers and their ability to make steady progress without taking significant risks.Their emphasis on stability to unnecessary change shaped my own values and decision-making process.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In addition to my family, my partner has played a significant role in shaping my values and influencing my approach to risk-taking. She possess a more adventurous spirit and an inclination towards taking calculated risks.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Over time, their perspective and influence have challenged my mindset of stability and contentment. Through their encouragement and support, I have learned the importance of stepping outside of my comfort zone and embracing new opportunities.

            <br>
            <li>
              Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>My logical and methodical approach to problem solving can definitely help me with my learning. It helps me analyze complex tasks, break them down into manageable steps, and develop efficient solutions. This approach ensures that I understand the concepts thoroughly and progress systematically through this journey.</li>
              <br>
              <br>
            </ul>
            <li>
              Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Considering my family's values that has greatly affected my mindset, this could impact my willingness to step out of my comfort zone and embrace new opportunities.
              <br>
              <br>
              However, I understand the need to find balance and challenge myself to grow. By being aware of these limitations, I can try to expand my horizons and push through with caluclated risks to progress in my learning journey.

            <br>
            <li>
              Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Going back to my previous answer where my wife wanted to start our application to New Zealand sooner, I faced resistance and tension during our discussions.
                <br>
                <br>
                To address the situation, I tried explaining my concerns and potential risks involved. However, looking back, I realize I may have focused too much on practical apsects and didn't fully understand her perspective.
                <br>
                <br>
                One approach I could have taken is to actively listen to her perspective and shown that her thoughts are also valued and acknowledged. This would have created an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding. Additionally, I could have recognized that she also made a calculated risks in her decision making process. In acknolwedging her ability to assess the situation, I would have demonstrated confidence in her judgement and we could have had a more productive discussion.
