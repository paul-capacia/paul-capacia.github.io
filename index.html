    <p> My name is Paul. My family moved to New Zealand 5 years ago. I've always wanted to be in the tech industry and I'm really excited that I have this opportunity to work on that goal. </p>
    <p>I have a daughter who likes to tinker with code and plays with design. She's one of the reasons why I am pursuing this course as I want to inspire her to think that anyone can achieve things if they work hard and put their minds to it.</p><br>
